THE NUT PROJECT CODING STYLE

================================================================================

In this project a certain coding style is desired. But first of, I ask you this.
Download the GNU coding conventions, and print them. DO NOT READ THEM but BURN
them as a symbolic gesture.

Now of to the real coding conventions.

Commit messages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When writing a commit message, it may be no longer than 80 characters, also it
has to be preceded by the section in which the changes were made.

E.g.
menu: Added a time zone configuration menu.
or
gen: Updated the coding conventions to better reflect our experiences


Line width
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most text editors have the option of placing a line at the 80th characters
position. If it is not enabled by default, please do as it marks the maximum
width of each line of code.

The reason for 80 characters of width is chosen so that with indentation of 8
characters, it will become evident that a helper function is needed after 3
indentations. Also it makes it much easier to read the code.

If the line width is exceeded, the function needs to be cut before the 80th
space, and has to be end aligned to the 80th character.


Indentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indentation, a.k.a. tabs is used for making the code more readable. This in
itself is great but only if everybody uses the same indentation levels. We have
opted to go for 8 characters. Some people may argue for either 2 or 4 spaces,
but believe me, when I say that when you have been staring at your screen for 6
hours or more, clear indentation is starting to become appreciated.

The argument against 8 characters is that it makes the line width too small too
easily. However I feel that when exceeding 3 indentations, one might start
wondering whether or not she/he needs a helper function for readability anyway.

Also it helps keeping the complexity of the functions to a minimum.

Also indentations are white spaces, not tab characters. Different editors have
different ways of screwing those up so don't use them. Instead configure your
editor to place 8 white spaces each time you hit tab.


Curly braces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Curly braces nearly always have the line to them selves. It is only in structure
and enum definitions that this is not the case. In the case of a structure of
enum the curly brace directly follows the definition. In the case of enums and
structures any definitions are allowed on the same line as the closing curly
brace.

For example:

int
foo()
{
        bar++;
        if (bar > 5)
        {
                bar = -5;
        }
        switch(foo)
        {
        case A:
        case B:
                break;
        }
}

struct foo_bar {
        int bear;
};

enum {
        A,
        B
} foo;


Function declarations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Function definitions are relatively tightly defined. To begin with the return
type needs to be on its own line, then the function header follows, with the
arguments on the very same line. If the arguments exceed 80 spaces either the
old C function definition style can be chosen (which I personally prefer) or
the line can be cut as required in the line width section.

The curly braces both get their own line and the code within the function body
has to be indented one level further than the function header.

A simple example below:

uint64_t
foo_bar(struct free_speech_not_free* beer, struct free_speech_not_free*
                                                               scottish_whiskey)
{
        return beer->size + scottish_whiskey->size;
}

or:

uint64_t
foo_bar(beer, scottish_whiskey)
struct free_speech_not_free* beer;
struct free_speech_not_free* scottish_whiskey;
{
        return beer->size + scottish_whiskey->size;
}


Conditional statements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conditional statements always have the line for them selves, and the curly
braces following the statement also have a line to them selves. Curly braces are
not used in case there is only one line in the conditional body.

Never ever put a statement directly behind the if statement, unless you have
something to hide.

Also each conditional body is indented one level above its header.

So it is:
if (foo)
        bar = foo;

instead of
if (foo) {bar = foo;} // U G L Y code


Switches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layout to a switch statement is maybe a little different from other projects
beside the Linux kernel, but because of the indentation style this is actually
a more desired way.

The switch statement has the line to itself again, and followed by the curly
braces.

cases are at the same level as the curly braces and the switch header, but all
other code between the curly braces is indented one more level.

cases always have a default condition which doesn't necessarily have to do
anything.

For example:

switch(foo)
{
case A:
        // Do something;
        break;
case B:
        // Do some more;
        break;
default:
}


Typedefs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typedefs aren't used regularly except for standard integer types, such as
uint8_t, uint16_t and generic C library typedefs.

Typedefs are nice for hiding details, but this fact might actually make it
harder to figure out how to approach the variable in we're dealing with.


Pointers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To keep things readable we're going to introduce some rules about pointer
declaration and dereferencing.

When the * is part of a pointer declaration it is attached to the type header,
but when dereferencing it is touching the variable. When finding the address of
a variable, it is part of the variable and thus is attached to the variable.

A simple example:
int* a = NULL;
int b = 0;
if (*a != NULL)
        a = &b;


Sizeof
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sizeof operator doesn't have to use parenthesis, but not doing so might
result in wrong interpretations by humans. To prevent this, the sizeof operator
is always used in its function like form.

So:
int i = sizeof struct foo_bar;
is wrong.

Please write it as:
int i = sizeof(struct foo_bar);

When allocating data, the sizeof operator gets a dereferencing to the variable
to allocate. For example:

struct foo_bar* foo = malloc(sizeof(*foo));
instead of
struct foo_bar* foo = malloc(sizeof(struct foo_bar));


Commenting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For comments the C99 comments are forbidden. Use C89 comments instead.

C99 = //
C89 = /* */

Comments should precede a function of which the name is not descriptive enough
and even then the programmer might consider changing the name so that it is
more intuitive.

Functions referenced from other files are commented in the headerfiles and along
with their parameters in the doxygen backslash notation.


Naming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When naming types, variables and functions people sometimes want to put some
form of abbreviation of the type in the name. Don't do this. Keep the names
simple. The programmer knows what he's doing and if he doesn't know it, the
compiler does.

Don't use the hungarian notation!!!
